    . Changed documentation to indicate class vs. instance methods
    + Use ORDINAL_POSITION for ordering of columns where possible
      (suggested by David Steinbrunner)
    + Guess ENUM types when using Postgres
      (suggested by David Steinbrunner)
    + Better discrimination between types - this reduces information
      on less discriminate DBs like SQLite but should make things
      work on Pg.
      Maybe this feature will be disabled unless you're using Pg
      to provide a maximum of information no matter how useless
      it may appear. avg(DATETIME) does not really make sense.

    . Fixed embarassing typos. That's what you get when you don't
      write automated tests for your code.
