    . Fixed t/01-sqlite.t to require DBD::SQLite 1.14 at minimum
      before it runs its tests, because the SQL trim() funciton is needed

0.07 20080822
    . Added NUMERIC and UNSIGNED BIGINT as types
    . Added SMALLINT as type
      (suggested by David Steinbrunner)
    . Added C<values> column that counts the number of different values per column
      (suggested by David Steinbrunner)

0.06 20080429
    . Fixed embarrassing bug, reported by David Steinbrunner
    . Added test against that bug

0.05 20080428
    . Pg bugfixes - ENUM should now be treated differently from a string
    . The trait hierarchy should now work

0.04 20080427
    . Changed documentation to indicate class vs. instance methods
    + Use ORDINAL_POSITION for ordering of columns where possible
      (suggested by David Steinbrunner)
    + Guess ENUM types when using Postgres
      (suggested by David Steinbrunner)
    + Better discrimination between types - this reduces information
      on less discriminate DBs like SQLite but should make things
      work on Pg.
      Maybe this feature will be disabled unless you're using Pg
      to provide a maximum of information no matter how useless
      it may appear. avg(DATETIME) does not really make sense.

    . Fixed missing prerequisites
    + Added unquoting of quoted column names (patch by Erik Rijkers)

0.02 20080408
    . Fixed embarassing typos. That's what you get when you don't
      write automated tests for your code.

    . Released unto an unsuspecting world
